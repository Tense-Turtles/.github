## Hi there 👋! 
We are a trio [[@shell-raiser](https://github.com/shell-raiser), [@thanmaisai](https://github.com/thanmaisai) & [@Beast-Sanjay](https://github.com/beast-sanjay) ], participating in hackathons and stuff 
<br> 
All our Hackathon and team projects go here, so feel free to look around


<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
